 *
 * @note Additional metrics are *OPTIONAL!*. Your game might not implement fast/slow
 * or maxCombo, but if they conceptually have the idea of fast/slow or maxCombo, the
 * metrics should exist anyway. Why not. it's nice.
 *
 * There are a couple edge cases where this might not apply. For example, if a game has
 * no timing windows, it can't really have a concept of "fast" or "slow".
 *
 * I can't think of a realistic case where a game might not have a concept of "maxCombo"
 * as that necessitates that you either can't miss, or can't hit.
